# Reproduce this super nice chart!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do. An example might be the following one (click to enlarge).

![*Hi, Martin, should this image has to have a caption?*](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)

Which is shown and detailed on <https://ourworldindata.org>.

## Goal of the project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv) with the following content (first lines):

| Common name of species | Species name       | Number of mammal populations included | Start year | End year | Average relative change in abundance |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Eurasian beaver        | Castor fiber       | 98                                    | 1960       | 2016     | 16705%                               |
| European bison         | Bison bonasus      | 20                                    | 1960       | 2016     | 16626%                               |
| Grey seal              | Halichoerus grypus | 18                                    | 1978       | 2016     | 6273%                                |
| Geoffroy's bat         | Myotis emarginatus | 12                                    | 1974       | 2016     | 5392%                                |
| Iberian wild goat      | Capra pyrenaica    | 9                                     | 1966       | 2012     | 3502%                                |

## Visualization priorities (from high to low)

-   line style with animal name labels
-   percent labels at line ends
-   time range label at line start
-   x-axis marks
-   arrow line style
-   annotation of brown bear
-   text coloring
-   relative font sizes
-   animal symbol for brown bear![](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Advanced-data-processing-with-R/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png)

Let's see how close you can get! As a starting point, you might want to have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com).

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best, Martin
